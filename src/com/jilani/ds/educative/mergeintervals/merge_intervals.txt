Intervals Related Problems
==========================
1. Merge Intervals

2. Insert Interval
	a. If input array is not sorted, then we need to sort O(NLogN) time 
	b. If input array is already sorted, we can optimize to O(N).

3. Intersection of Intervals
	
	
4. Conflicting Appointments 

	a. [Follow up] Given a list of appointments, find all the conflicting appointments.

		Appointments: [[4,5], [2,3], [3,6], [5,7], [7,8]]
		Output: 
		[4,5] and [3,6] conflict. 
		[3,6] and [5,7] conflict.
		
		
5. Minimum Meeting Rooms (hard) #
	Given a list of intervals representing the start and end time of ‘N’ meetings, find the minimum number of rooms required to hold all the meetings.
	
	a) Given a list of intervals, find the point where the maximum number of intervals overlap.
	b) Given a list of intervals representing the arrival and departure times of trains to a train station, 
		our goal is to find the minimum number of platforms required for the train station so that 
		no train has to wait.
